While it mentions 'studies show' and 'one comparison', it lacks specific citations or links to these studies, which slightly lowers the citation score. However, the claims made are generally accepted knowledge within the programming community and do not appear to be hallucinatory."

The reasoning flows logically from definition to characteristics, how they work, and practical implications. While it explicitly mentions 'Kyle Simpson's \"You Don't Know JS\" series', it doesn't cite specific page numbers or chapter titles, which would improve the citation score. There are no apparent hallucinations."
